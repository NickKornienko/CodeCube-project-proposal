# CodeCube-project-proposal

The purpose of this project is to use a local model to process audio files of human speech and identify the language spoken. The model will be trained using an LLM such as Llama-2 with publicly availible audio datasets. Using a local model to process this data has the advantage of using less computational resources since the model is only built to process a narrow range of data, compared to an LLM which may deliever better results, but will be more resource intensive.
